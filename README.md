Solutions to reddit's daily programmer problems in no particular order. Mostly for my own learning and development of skill? 
For now has solutions to only easy problems in c++ and python. Ideally submit
one problem a week with a little review of thought process and any diffuclties
or new things I learned about with these problems.
